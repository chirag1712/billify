# Billify - sharing expenses and budget tracking made easier


## Usage
To run the backend, run the following steps:
1. `cd backend` and `npm i` to install all neccesary packages used on the server.
2. Use `/backend/sampleDbCreds.json` as a template to fill out `/backend/dbCreds.json` for credentials to use the production database.
3. Once you have done the above steps, you can start the server by running `npm run start` from the backend directory.

To run the mobile app, we can open the frontend folder in Android Studio, add the app directory as a config, choose a device, build then run.
